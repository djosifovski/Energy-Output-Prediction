# Energy Output Prediction

## Motivation
A combined cycle power plant (CCPP) is an energy plant that converts a source of heat into mechanical energy. Predicting energy output of a power plant is important in order to maximize the profit from the available megawatt hours. In this project the goal is to predict the energy output of a CCPP with an artificial neural network (ANN). The dataset, which consists of these input and target variables, was collected over a six-year period.

## Methodology
This is a regression type of problem in which an artificial neural network was built using the `TensorFlow` framework. As a single number evaluation metric MSE is used where MSE=0.9152.
